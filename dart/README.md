[English](https://github.com/czg99/flutter_gopher/blob/main/dart/README.md) | [中文](https://github.com/czg99/flutter_gopher/blob/main/dart/README_zh.md)

Flutter Gopher Dart Library is a core component in Flutter plugins generated by the Flutter Gopher tool, providing FFI binding support between Flutter applications and Golang backends.

## Features

- Provides dynamic library loading mechanism, supporting multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Implements asynchronous call support, allowing Go functions to be executed asynchronously in Dart
- Provides unified error handling mechanism
- Simplifies the use of FFI binding code

## Installation

This library is typically automatically integrated into Flutter plugins generated by the Flutter Gopher tool, requiring no manual installation. If you need to use it separately, you can add a dependency in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_gopher: ^0.0.1
```
